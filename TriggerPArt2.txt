----Instead of Triggers
-----------------------
--If there are multiple triggers along with instead of trigger 
---on the table, the instead of trigger is fired first in the order.
--INSTEAD of triggers can be created on views.
--we can define only one instead of trigger per INSERT, UPDATE, 
---or DELETE statement on a table or view

create trigger trig_d1
on dept instead of delete
as 
begin
declare
@dno int
select @dno=deptno from inserted
insert into deptAudit values  (@dno,getdate(),user_id())
select * from students;
print 'this table has references of the dept table... pls donot delete'
end;

create trigger deptDelete
on dept
after delete 
as 
begin
declare 
@dno int
select @dno=deptno from inserted
delete from dept
where deptno=@dno
print 'deleted'
end;

select USER_NAME()
select user_id()



select * from dept
select * from Students

delete from dept
where deptno=40
